Testing constants:
	2 is not null
	x is not null
	null is null

Comparing some terms:
	1<2	true
	1>2	false
	1>null	false
	1 IS NULL 	false
	null IS NULL 	true

Testing the parser changes:
Should print "b IS NULL and a<2":
	b IS NULL  and a<2

new transaction: 3
Testing the getVal method
Here is the entire table
	a=1	b=x1
	a=2	b=null
	a=3	b=x3
	a=4	b=null
transaction 3 committed

new transaction: 4
Executing: select a, b from t where b is null and a<3
	a=2	b=null
transaction 4 committed
